For video export to work, after installing the Video Export library it requires replacing the videoExport.jar located in `Documents\Processing\libraries\VideoExport\library\videoExport.jar` <br>
with [this version](https://github.com/hamoid/video_export_processing/blob/kotlinGradle/p5library/videoExport/library/videoExport.jar), if you are using Processing 4+ <br>
Make sure you have [FFmpeg](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/) downloaded and in your PATH environment variable.
