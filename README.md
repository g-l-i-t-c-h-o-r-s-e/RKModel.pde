# WIP
Need to fix animations, textures, and probably other stuff.

Leave feedback [here](https://gist.github.com/g-l-i-t-c-h-o-r-s-e/5590148123825db0205a1ff0d0428f0e) if you have any comments! /) <br>
bones mostly aligned [in this branch](https://github.com/g-l-i-t-c-h-o-r-s-e/RKModel.pde/tree/bone-alignment), though leg bones seem out of place currently <br>
the bones and mesh are fully aligned and scaled evenly in [this branch](https://github.com/g-l-i-t-c-h-o-r-s-e/RKModel.pde/tree/stripped-rowmajor)
